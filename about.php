				<h2>About Us</h2>
				<p>Car Rental is Australia's first and largest peer-to-peer car rental service. We make it possible for people to rent cars from other people with confidence. We do this by creating a 'trusted marketplace' where Owners list their vehicles for FREE and Renters find and book the vehicles after passing our verification processes. Coverage is provided for accidental damage and theft. <br><br>

				We specialise in rental periods from 2 days â€“ 365 days and are up to 50% cheaper than traditional car rental companies. We also offer more flexibility than car leasing companies. For Owners we offer the ability to earn money from a vehicle they are not using. Since 2010 Car Rental has managed over 10,000 rentals for thousands of Owners and Renters.</p>
